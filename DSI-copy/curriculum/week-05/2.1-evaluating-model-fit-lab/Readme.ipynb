    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates your knowledge and understanding of kNN classifications on a dataset using Python syntax and the kNN functions library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [wine quality dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/wine.csv), build a kNN classifier on ‘density’, ‘sulphates’, and ‘residual sugar’ features, with ‘high quality’ as target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the best k-value by looping through a range\n",
    "- Plot the results of your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a Python program to perform kNN Classification on the dataset\n",
    "- Tune the kNN model by finding the optimal K value\n",
    "\n",
    "BONUS:\n",
    "- Run Logistic Regression on the dataset\n",
    "- Tune Logistic model with regularization\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Program to perform kNN Classification, iteratively searching for the best k\n",
    "\n",
    "BONUS:\n",
    "- Create a short writeup interpreting your findings\n",
    "- Build a logistic regression model\n",
    "- Compare your models with an ROC chart and/or AUC score\n",
