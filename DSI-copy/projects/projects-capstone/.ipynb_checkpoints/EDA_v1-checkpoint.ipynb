Note that the activity may involve an administrative official as well as that of an agency. The general rule for an entry in this variable is whether administrative action occurred in the context of the case. Note too that this variable identifies the specific federal agency. If the action occurred in a state agency, adminAction is coded as 117 (State Agency). See the variable adminActionState for the identity of the state.  \\r<br/> <br/>Determination of whether administration action occurred in the context of the case was made by reading the material which appears in the summary of the case (the material preceding the Court\\'s opinion) and, if necessary, those portions of the prevailing opinion headed by a I or II. \\r<br/> <br/>Action by an agency official is considered to be administrative action except when such an official acts to enforce criminal law.    \\r<br/> <br/>If an agency or agency official \"denies\" a \"request\" that action be taken, such denials are considered agency action.  \\r<br/> <br/>If two federal agencies are mentioned (e.g., INS and BIA), the one whose action more directly bears on the dispute will appear; otherwise the agency that acted more recently.

       "   'his variable and the next one (authorityDecision2) specify the bases on which the Supreme Court rested its decision with regard to each legal provision that the Court considered in the case (see variable lawType).\\r<br/> <br/>Neither of them lends itself to objectivity.  Many cases arguably rest on more than two bases for decision. Given \\r<br/>that the Court\\'s citation of its precedents also qualifies as a common law decision and that most every case can be considered as at least partially based thereon, common law is the default basis for the Court\\'s decisions.  With the exception of decrees and brief non-orally argued decisions you may safely add common law to those cases lacking a second basis for decision.      \\r<br/> <br/>Because one of these bases commonly occurs conjoined with another, the interpretation of the substantive provisions of a federal statute and the Supreme Court\\'s exercise of its supervisory power over the lower federal courts; two separate variables (authorityDecision1, authorityDecision2) follow.  The coding is the same in both. In the foregoing example, the first variable will contain a \"4,\" the second a \"3.\"  In a case involving congressional acquiescence to longstanding administrative construction of a statute, these variables should appear as \"5\" and \"4.\"  If two bases are identified, and if one is more heavily emphasized, it should appear in the first of the two variables.\\r<br/> <br/>Considerable congruence should obtain between the entry in these variables and the code that appears in the lawType variable.  Thus, if a constitutional provision appears in the lawType variable, a \"1\" or a \"2\" will typically appear in either authorityDecision1 or authorityDecision2.  Similarly, if lawType displays a statute, either authorityDecision1 or authorityDecision2 will likely show a \"4.\"   \\r<br/> <br/>A common exception is where the Court determines the constitutionality of a federal statute, or where judge-made rules are applied to determine liability under various federal statutes, including civil rights acts (e.g., Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522), or the propriety of the federal courts\\' use of state statutes of limitations to adjudicate federal statutory claims (e.g., Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42).\\r<br/> <br/>The decision rules governing each of the authority for decision codes are as follows:\\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 1: The majority determined the constitutionality of some action taken by some unit or official of the federal government, including an interstate compact. \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"1\" if 139 appears in the lawSupp variable. \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"1\" if 111 appears in the lawSupp variable. \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 2: Did the majority determine the constitutionality of some action taken by some unit or official of a state or local government?  If so, enter a \"2.\" \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 3: If the rules governing codes \"1-2,\" \"4-7\" are answered negatively or do not apply, enter a \"3.\"  A \"3,\" then, serves as the residual code for these variables.  \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"3\" if 508 appears in the lawSupp variable. \\r<br/> <br/>Non-statutorily based Judicial Power topics in the issue variable generally warrant a \"3.\" \\r<br/> <br/>Most cases arising under the Court\\'s original jurisdiction should receive a \"3.\" \\r<br/> <br/>All cases containing a \"4\" in the type of decision variable = 3. \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"3\" in cases in which the Court denied or dismissed the petition for review or where the decision of a lower court is affirmed by a tie vote. \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 4: Did the majority interpret a federal statute, treaty, or court rule?  If so, enter a \"4.\" \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"4\" rather than a \"3\" if the Court interprets a federal statute governing the powers or jurisdiction of a federal court.  In other words, a statutory basis for a court\\'s exercise of power or jurisdiction does not require that a \"3\" supplement a \"4\";  the latter alone suffices.  \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"4\" rather than a \"2\" where the Court construes a state law as incompatible with a federal law. \\r<br/> <br/>Do not enter only a \"4\" where an administrative agency or official acts \"pursuant to\" a statute.  All agency action is purportedly done pursuant to legislative authorization of one sort or another.  A \"4\" may be coupled to a \"5\" (see below) only if the Court interprets the statute to determine if administrative action is proper. \\r<br/> <br/>In workers\\' compensation litigation involving statutory interpretation and, in addition, a discussion of jury determination and/or the sufficiency of the evidence, enter either a \"4\" and a \"3\" or a \"3\" and a \"4.\"  If no statute is identified in the syllabus, only enter a \"3.\" \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 5: Did the majority treats federal administrative action in arriving at its decision?  If so, enter a \"5.\" \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"5\\' and a \"4,\" but not a \"5\" alone, where an administrative official interprets a federal statute.  \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"5\" if the issue = 90120. \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 6: Did the majority say in approximately so many words that under its diversity jurisdiction it is interpreting state law?  If so, enter a \"6.\" \\r<br/> <br/>For a code of 7: Did the majority indicate that it used a judge-made \"doctrine\" or \"rule?\"  If so, enter a \"7.\"  Where such is used in conjunction with a federal law or enacted rule, a \"7\" and \"4\" should appear in the two variables of this record.\\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"7\" if the Court without more merely specifies the disposition the Court has made of the case and cites one or more of its own previously decided cases;  but enter a \"3\" if the citation is qualified by the word, \"see.\" \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"7\" if the case concerns admiralty or maritime law, or some other aspect of the law of nations other than a treaty, which qualifies as a \"4.\"\\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"7\" if the case concerns the retroactive application of a constitutional provision or a previous decision of the Court. \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"7\" if the case concerns an exclusionary rule, the harmless error rule (though not the statute), the abstention doctrine, comity, res judicata, or collateral estoppel.  Note that some of these, especially comity issues, likely warrant an entry in both authorityDecision variables: a \"7\" as well as a \"3.\" \\r<br/> <br/>Enter a \"7\" if the case concerns a \"rule\" or \"doctrine\" that is not specified as related to or connected with a constitutional or statutory provision (e.g., 376 U.S. 398).\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

This variable will also contain \"unspecifiable\" where one state sues another under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and where parties or issue cannot be determined because of a tied vote or lack of information.\\r<br/> <br/>Note especially that the direction (pro- or anti-liability)of the three liability variables (80060, 80070, and 80080) depend on the disposition the Court made of the case, and which party won or lost. For 80070 -- non-governmental liability - a liberal vote and case decision support the injured person, organiation, or thing (res).  For 80060 - governmental liability - a vote and case outcome that supports government is invariably defined as liberal. Note that if the injured entity is the other party in the case, said party loses, by definition.  On the other hand, of course, if the injured entity wins, then of necessity the government loses. Where liability is assigned to both plaintiff and respondent, direction is considered indetermnable.\\r<br/> <br/>For purposes of the governmental liability issue, government includes state and local governmental entities, foreign governments, and governmentally owned property.  In the rare instance of a conflict between governmental body and an injured person, organiation, or thing the governmental outcome controls directionality. Most such conflicts, however, locate in other issues; e.g., attorneys\\' and governemtnal employees\\' compensation or fees, and military personnel and veterans.  \\r<br/> <br/>It bears emphasizing that the entry for directionality is determined by reference to the issue variable.

       "   'ecisionType=1: Cases the Court decides by a signed opinion. Note that for the 1946 terms to present, decisionType=1 cases are those that the Court decided by a signed opinion and in which it heard oral arguments. This is true for the 1791-1945 terms too. When both these conditions are met, the case is coded as decisionType=1. But the second condition\\xc2\\x97oral argument\\xc2\\x97is no longer necessary for a decisionType=1 classification. That\\'s because the dates of oral argument were not reported for many cases that were likely argued (if only because the reporter noted, \"After argument\\xc2\\x85\"). We are working to locate these (many) missing dates and would appreciate any leads from users.\\r<br/> <br/>Jettisoning the oral argument requirement also means that there are many cases that were probably not orally argued but that are included as decisionType=1 cases because a justice is listed as delivering the opinion of the Court. For users that want to examine cases we know for sure were orally argued, we suggest selecting on dateArgument\\xc2\\x97with the important caveat that you will miss cases that were likely argued but are lacking a date.\\r<br/> <br/>decisionType=2: Cases decided with an opinion but without hearing oral argument; i.e., per curiam opinions.  In the legacy data, decisionType2 cases include cases in which the Court (or reporter) did not use the term \"per curiam\" but rather \"The Court [said],\" \"By the Court,\" or \"By direction of the Court.\" If these cases identify the author of the opinion, we code an opinion writer. \\r<br/> <br/>decisionType=4: Decrees.  This infrequent type of decision usually arises under the Court\\'s original jurisdiction and involves state boundary disputes.  The justices will typically appoint a special master to take testimony and render a report, the bulk of which generally becomes the Court\\'s decision.  The presence of the label, \"decree,\" distinguishes this type of decision from the others.\\r<br/> <br/>decisionType=5: Cases decided by an equally divided vote.  When a justice fails to participate in a case or when the Court has a vacancy, the participating justices may cast a tie vote.  In such cases, the Reports merely state that \"the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided vote\" and the name of any nonparticipating justice(s).  Their effect is to uphold the decision of the court whose decision the Supreme Court reviewed.  \\r<br/> <br/>decisionType=6: This decision type is a variant of decisionType=1 cases.  It differs from type 1 in that no individual justice\\'s name appears as author of the Court\\'s opinion.  Instead, these unsigned orally argued cases are labeled as decided \"per curiam.\"  The difference between this type and decisionType=2 is the occurrence of oral argument in the former but not the latter.  In both types the opinion of the Court is unsigned.  \\r<br/> <br/>decisionType=7:  Judgments of the Court.  This decision type is also a variant of the formally decided cases.  It differs from type 1 in that less than a majority of the participating justices agree with the opinion produced by the justice assigned to write the Court\\'s opinion.  Except for those interested only in the authors of the opinions of the Court, decisionType=7 should be included in analyses of the Court\\'s formally decided cases.  See also the notes under decisionType=1. \\r<br/> <br/>The database does not contain all of the non-orally argued per curiam decisions (decisionType=2).  The Reports contain large numbers of brief, non-orally argued per curiam decisions. The database includes only those for which the Court has provided a summary, as well as those without a summary in which one or more of the justices wrote an opinion. \\r<br/> <br/>Along similar lines, the database also does not contain memorandum decisions or \"back-of-the-book\" U.S. Reports cases with the exceptions of, first, volumes 131 and 154. In these volumes, the reporters included (in the Appendices) cases previously omitted or \"not hitherto reported in full.\" Second, we are trying to include all orally argued cases in the back-of-the-book (the Database already contains \"front-of-the-book\" orally argued cases). All decisionType=5 orally argued cases, even if in the back of the book, already have been entered. We are in the process of adding decisionType=6 back-of-the-book cases.

       "   \"n entry in this variable indicates that the Court  either declared unconstitutional an act of Congress; a state or territorial statute, regulation, or constitutional provision; or a municipal or other local ordinance. In coding this variable we consulted several sources. Most helpful was the Congressional Research Service's Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (CONAN) (https://www.congress.gov/constitution-annotated) and the appendix to volume 131 of the U.S. Reports.\\r<br/> <br/>Note that the Court need not necessarily specify in so many words that a law has been declared unconstitutional.

Consolidted Gas Co. of New York, 53 L Ed 382 (1909).\\r<br/> <br/>The summary frequently, though not invariably, will indicate such action in its statement of the Court's holdings. Hence, where such action may have occurred, it may be necessary to read carefully the opinion of the Court to determine whether an entry should be made in this variable. \\r<br/> <br/>Where federal law pre-empts a state statute or a local ordinance, unconstitutionality does not result unless the Court's opinion so states.  Nor are administrative regulations the subject of declarations of unconstitutionality unless the declaration also applies to the law on which it is based.

The Court eliminated the possibility of such duplication by including the last two digits of the appropriate term before the assigned docket number. Since the 1971 Term, the Court has also operated with a single docket.  Cases filed pursuant to the Court\\'s appellate jurisdiction have a two-digit number corresponding to the term in which they were filed, followed by a hyphen and a number varying from one to five digits.  Cases invoking the Court\\'s original jurisdiction have a number followed by the abbreviation, \"Orig.\" \\r<br/> <br/>During much of the legacy period, docket number do not exist in the Reports; a handful of more modern cases also lack a docket number. For these, the docket variable has no entry.\\r<br/> <br/>For administrative  purposes, the Court uses the letters, \"A,\" \"D,\" and \"S,\" in place of the term year to identify applications (\"A\") for stays or  bail, proceedings of disbarment or discipline of attorneys (\"D\"),  and matters being held indefinitely for one reason or another  (\"S\").

       "   \"his variable identifies the issue for each decision. Although criteria for the identification of issues are hard to articulate, the focus here is on the subject matter of the controversy (e.g., sex discrimination, state tax, affirmative action) rather than its legal basis (e.g., the equal protection clause) (see the variable lawType).\\r<br/> <br/>This variable and its counterpart, issue area, cover the waterfront of the Court's decisions.  However, neither of them provide the specificity that users commonly want.  The three legal provision variables reduce the generic quality of issue and issue area to a more specific level.  They are discussed in the first of the legal provisions below.   \\r<br/> <br/>Because the database extends over four centuries of the Court's decisions during which time the Court's jurisdiction changed drastically, the description of many specific variables does not provide a good fit.  Thus, for example, 'debtors' rights,' which locates in the civil rights issue area, contains many nineteenth century cases that have little, if anything, to do with civil rights as understood today.  Nor do a vast majority of early takings cases have any reference to due process, and many of the early criminal procedure cases don't involve crimes at all. Conversely, to have lumped all railroad cases, bar none, into one variable would have erased the many types of situations in which nineteenth and early twentieth century railroads found themselves. \\r<br/> <br/>This situation results because the original (Spaeth) database began with the Warren Court, followed by its predecessor, the Vinson Court. We made a decision to retain the twentieth century listing and apply it as best we could to the eighteenth and nineteenth century decisions.  We found it possible with the addition of only the seven common law law decisions (variables 140010-140070), plus a couple of others.  Obviously, this decision produced definitonal stretching.  Users, of course, may redefine issues to suit themselves \\r<br/> <br/>This variable identifies issues on the basis of the Court's own statements as to what the case is about.  The objective is to categorize the case from a public policy standpoint, a perspective that the legal basis for decision (lawType) commonly disregards.\\r<br/> <br/>A few issues pertain only to the heritage (legacy) cases; those decided between 1791 and 1946.  These include the private action category, typically common law issues: real property, personal property, contracts, evidence, civil procedure, wills and trusts, and commercial transactions. Others pertain to slavery, land claims (mostly state and territorial), executive authority vis-a-vis congress or the states, and incorporation of foreign territories.\\r<br/> <br/>Unlike the lawType variable where the number of legal provisions at issue has no preordained upper bound, each legal provision should generally not have more than a single issue applied to it. A second issue should apply only when a preference for one rather than the other cannot readily be made.  Of the many thousand records in the database, few have a legal basis for decision that applies to a second issue. (If you are interested in decisions with more than one issue or legal provision, use one of the datasets organized by issue/legal provision.)   \\r<br/> <br/>Because the database spans the entire four-century history of the Supreme Court, It is desirable that the list of modern issues be related to those of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Thus, in specifying the issue in a legacy case, the one that best accords with what today's Court would consider it to be is chosen. This produces a bit of tension, most all of which only requires a broadening of the scope of the relevant issues, rather than the creation of new time-specific ones.  Thus, although state and local governments were not bound to adhere to the provisions of the Bill of Rights until well after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, many cases did arise involving aspects of the First Amendment, search and seizure, notice and hearing, etc.  These are treated compatibly with the modern use of the relevant provision of the Bill of Rights. \\r<br/> <br/>The same rule applies to statutory issues, such as rules of procedure.  Although their legal provision is Supreme Court Rules, they are coded as issues of civil (90110) or criminal (10370) procedure even though they antedate the relevant Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure.\\r<br/> <br/>Prize cases in which vessels on the high seas are captured and brought into American ports and the confiscation acts resulting from the Civil War and World War I are treated either as due process takings clause cases (40070) or as cases involving the jurisdiction of the federal courts (90320 or 90330) to decide the legality of the capture or confiscation.         \\r<br/> <br/>The variable codes 260 issues, each of which has an identifying number. They are ordered below by their larger issue area: criminal procedure (10010-10600), civil rights (20010-20410), First Amendment (30010-30020), due process (40010-40070), privacy (50010-50040), attorneys (60010-60040), unions (70010-70210), economic activity (80010-80350), judicial power (90010-90520), federalism (100010-100130), interstate relation (110010-110030), federal taxation (120010-120040), miscellaneous (130010-130020), and private law (140010-140080).  These comprise the codes for a separate variable, Issue Area, that is described immediately following this one.\\r<br/> <br/>The scope of these categories is as follows:  criminal procedure encompasses the rights of persons accused of crime, except for the due process rights of prisoners (issue 40040).  \\r<br/> <br/>Civil rights includes non-First Amendment freedom cases which pertain to classifications based on race (including American Indians), age, indigency, voting, residency, military or handicapped status, gender, and alienage.  Purists may wish to treat the military issues (20230, 20240, 20250) and Indian cases (20150, 20160) as economic activity, while others may wish to include the privacy category as a subset of civil rights.  \\r<br/> <br/>First Amendment encompasses the scope of this constitutional provision, but do note that not every case in the First Amendment group directly involves the interpretation and application of a provision of the First Amendment.  Some, for example, may only construe a precedent, or the reviewability of a claim based on the First Amendment, or the scope of an administrative rule or regulation that impacts the exercise of First Amendment freedoms.  In other words, not every record that displays a First Amendment issue will correspondingly display a provision of the First Amendment in its legal provision variable (lawType).\\r<br/> <br/>Due process is limited to non-criminal guarantees and, like First Amendment issues, need not show 207 (Fifth Amendment Due Process)  or 230 (Fourteenth Amendment Due Process) in the lawType variable.  Some of you may wish to include state court assertion of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants and the takings clause as part of judicial power and economic activity, respectively, rather than due process.  \\r<br/> <br/>The four issues comprising privacy may be treated as a subset of civil rights.  \\r<br/> <br/>Because of their peculiar role in the judicial process, a separate attorney category has been created, which also includes their compensation and licenses, along with trhose of governmental officials and employees.  You may wish to include these issues with economic activity, however.  \\r<br/> <br/>Unions encompass those issues involving labor union activity.  You may wish to redefine this category for yourself or combine it, in whole or in part, with economic activity.  \\r<br/> <br/>Economic activity is largely commercial and business related;  it includes tort actions  and employee actions vis-a-vis employers.  Issues 80140 (government corruption)and 80150 (zoning) are only tangential to the other issues located in economic activity.  \\r<br/> <br/>Judicial power concerns the exercise of the judiciary's own power.  To the extent that a number of these issues concern federal-state court relationships, you may wish to include them in the federalism category.  \\r<br/> <br/>Federalism pertains to conflicts and other relationships between the federal government and the states, except for those between the federal and state courts.  Interstate relations contain three types of disputes which occur between or among states.  \\r<br/> <br/>Federal taxation concerns the Internal Revenue Code and related statutes.  Miscellaneous contains three groups of cases that do not fit into any other category.  \\r<br/> <br/>Private law relates to disputes between private persons involving real and personal property, contracts, evidence, civil procedure, torts, wills and trusts, and commercial transactions.  Prior to the passage of the Judges' Bill of 1925 much -- arguably most -- of the Court's cases concerned such issues.  The Judges' Bill gave the Court control of its docket, as a result of which such cases have disappeared from the Court's docket in preference to litigation of more general applicability.\\r<br/> <br/>If interest lies in a particular issue that has a specific legal or constitutional component, comprehensive coverage may be insured by listing not only the issue(s) that bear thereon, but also the appropriate code(s) from the lawType variable.  Thus, if the right to counsel is the focus, issues 10120, 20320, and 20330 will fall within its scope, as will code 214 (Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel) from the lawType variable.  Also recognize that the party variables (petitioner,  petitionerState, respondent, \\r<br/>respondentState) may also help locate the cases of interest.\\r<br/> <br/>Note that jury instructions (10220) need not necessarily occur in the context of criminal action.  This is especially so in heritage cases.\\r<br/> <br/>Issue 80110 (state regulation of business) also includes that of local governments.  These are combined with state regulation because many heritage cases involve both.\\r<br/> <br/>Issue 90110 (federal rules of civil procedure) includes Supreme Court Rules, the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in civil litigation, Circuit Court Rules, state rules, and admiralty rules. \\r<br/> <br/>Natonal supremacy cases, in the context of federal-state conflicts (10050-100120)involve the general welfare, contract, supremacy, or interstate commerce causes, or the enforcement clause of the 14th Amendment.  These cases are distinguishable from the pre-empton cases (100020 abd 100030) because they have a constitutional basis for decision.\\r<br/> <br/>Note that the legal provision variable and the first five background variables may supplement specification of case issue.  Thus, for example, if you are interested in the huge mass of railroad cases generally that prevailed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century decisions, case name will be of more help than the issues pertaining to railroad litigation.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"),\n",

Do not assume that these three legal provisions are ordinally ordered.  They are not.  Any one of them can be considered more important to the Court\\'s decision than either of the others.  And that also applies to the issue and issue area of the case.  Importance is a matter to be determined by the user\\'s objectives.  \\r<br/> <br/>Because of our ignorance of the overall contents of the pre-1946 decision making, we simply adhered to the structure and distinctive characteristics of the modern Court.  Accordingly, we created a modernized interface that did not adequately comport with the distinctive features of the heritage cases. Not only did they treat distinctive constitutional provisions as one (e.g., upholding or voiding governmental action on the combined basis of due process and equal protection), with the interstate commerce clause thrown in for good measure.  Furthermore, these early Courts also created a much used non-textual constitutional provision: freedom of contract, which was treated independently of the Constitution\\'s contract clause.\\r<br/> <br/>Relatedly, we mistakenly allowed for only one type 0f legal provision (i.e. Constitution, constitutional amendment, federal statute, court rules, other, infrequently litigated statutes, and state or local law) per case record.)  If a second or third legal provision warranted inclusion into the case record, entirely new and separate records needed to be created.  This is not a serious problem with the post-1946 Courts, but it definitely is with the preceding ones.\\r<br/> <br/>At the other extreme, this database does allow for the inclusion of infrequently litigated federal statutes, but not those of the state and local governments. Users interested in the Court\\'s treatment of the states are likely interested in the sort of state laws at issue and the result of Supreme Court action.  E.g., did the Court treat all morals legislation the same; i.e., temperance, prostitution, obscenity, gambling, regardless of states or human litigants?  Consult the variables \\'origin of case State\\' and \\'source of case State.\\' To determine the specifics of state or local law, consult the opinion of the case itself.  Although a major objective of this database was to make it self-standing, we were not able to achieve this objective because of inadequate oversight and limited resources.  To have included this datum would have been a counsel of perfection. Unfortunately, the other principle investigators and I are incapable of attaining such a status.        \\r<br/> <br/>The basic criterion to determine the legal provision(s) is the \"summary\" in the Lawyers\\' Edition.  Supplementary is a reference to it in at least one of the numbered holdings in the summary of the United States Reports.  This summary, which the Lawyers\\' Edition of the U.S. Reports labels \"Syllabus By Reporter Of Decisions,\" appears in the official Reports immediately after the date of decision and before the  main opinion in the case. Where this summary lacks numbered holdings, it is treated as though it has but one number.\\r<br/> <br/>Be aware that the Reports do not cite a given statute the same in every case.  Hence, the total number of cases in which a case is the legal provision considered by the Court may be higher than the database reports.  \\r<br/> <br/>Observe that where a state or local government allegedly abridges a provision of the Bill of Rights even though it has not been made binding on the states because it has not been \"incorporated\" into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, identification is to the specific guarantee rather than to the Fourteenth Amendment. \\r<br/> <br/>The legal basis for decision need not be formally stated. For example, a reference in the summary to the appointment of counsel under the Constitution or to the self-incrimination clause warrants entry of the appropriate code.  (E.g., United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77; Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18). \\r<br/> <br/>Also note that occasionally a holding may pertain to more than one legal basis for decision.  In such cases, the additional basis or bases are specified as though they are numbered holdings, or as though they are a holding without numbers. \\r<br/> <br/>By no means does every record have an entry in the lawType variable.  Only constitutional provisions, federal statutes, and court rules are entered here.  This variable typically will have no entry in cases that concern the Supreme Court\\'s supervisory authority over the lower federal courts;  those where the Supreme Court\\'s decision does not rest on a constitutional provision, federal statute, or court rule;  provisions of the common law; decrees; and nonstatutory cases arising under the Court\\'s original jurisdiction.\\r<br/> <br/> In cases where the Court considers multiple legal provisions no attempt is made to order their appearance.  Where the constitutionality of a federal law is challenged, to give either the constitutional provision or the statute primacy would be arbitrary.  To the extent that any order characterizes these lawType entries, it likely is the sequence in which they appear in the summary.  \\r<br/> <br/>Beyond the foregoing, observe that an entry should appear in this variable only when the summary indicates that the majority opinion discusses the legal provision at issue.  The mere fact that the Court exercises a certain power (e.g., its original jurisdiction, as in Arkansas v. Tennessee, 397 U.S. 91), or makes reference in its majority opinion rather than in the summary that a certain constitutional provision, statute, or frequently used common law rule applies (e.g., the \"equal footing\" principle which pertains to the admission of new states under Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, as Utah v. United States, 403 U.S. 9, illustrates) provides no warrant for any entry.\\r<br/> <br/>There are three exceptions to this \"discussion\" requirement, the first of which dismisses the writ of certiorari as \"improvidently granted\" either in so many words (e.g., Johnson v. United States, 401 U.S. 846) or dismisses it on this basis implicitly (e.g., Baldonado v. California, 366 U.S. 417).  In such cases, the code 508 should appear.  More often than not, these cases have no summary.  Note that the phrase is a term of art: 1) it overrides any substantive provision that the summary may mention (e.g., Conway v. California Adult Authority, 396 U.S. 107);  2) it does not apply where the Supreme Court takes jurisdiction on appeal.  \\r<br/> <br/>In the second exception the Court, without discussion, remands a case to a lower court for consideration in light of an earlier decision.  The summary of the earlier case is then consulted and the instant case coded with the entry that appeared there (e.g., Wheaton v. California, 386 U.S. 267).  If a discussion in the summary precedes the remand, this variable should be governed by that discussion as well as the basis for decision in the case that the lower court is instructed to consider.  Usually these bases will be identical (e.g., Maxwell v. Bishop, 398 U.S. 262).\\r<br/> <br/>The third exception to the \"discussion\" criterion involves the legality of administrative agency action without specific reference to the statute under which the agency acted.  Inasmuch as administrative agencies may only act pursuant to statute, the majority opinion was consulted to determine the statute in question (e.g., National Labor Relations Board v. United Insurance Co. of America, 390 U.S. 254).  The same situation may characterize the statute under which a court exercises jurisdiction (e.g., the Court of Claims in United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1).\\r<br/> <br/>As indicated, this variable should usually lack an entry if the numbered holding(s) indicates that the Court\\'s decision rests on its supervisory authority over the federal judiciary, the common law, or diversity jurisdiction. \\r<br/> <br/>Note that where a state or local government allegedly abridges a provision of the Bill of Rights that has been made binding on the states because it has been incorporated into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, identification is to the specific guarantee rather than to the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. \\r<br/> <br/>International treaties and conventions, which rarely serve as the basis for the Court\\'s decision, are identified (in the lawSupp variable) as a treaty (509), an interstate compact as Interstate Compact (510), an executive order as Executive Order (511), and a statute of a territory of the U.S., which is not in the U.S. Code or the Statutes at Large, as Territory Statute (512). \\r<br/> <br/>A case that challenges the constitutionality of a federal statute, court or common law rule will usually contain at least two legal bases for decision:  the constitutional provision as well as the challenged statute or rule.  \\r<br/> <br/>Where a heading concerns the review of agency action under a statute, but the statute is not identified, it is ascertained from the opinion (e.g., National Labor Relations Board v. United Insurance Co. of America, 390 U.S. 254).  So also where the decision turns on the statutory jurisdiction of a federal court, and the holding does not specify it (e.g., United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1).\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

Options include 1) date of confirmation, 2) date of seating, 3) cases decided after seating, and 4) cases argued and decided after seating.   A strong natural court is delineated by the addition of a new justice or the departure of an incumbent.  A weak natural court, by comparison, is any group of sitting justices even if lengthy vacancies occurred.  \\r<br/> <br/>The values below divide the Courts into strong natural courts, each of which begins when the Reports first specify that the new justice is present but not necessarily participating in the reported case.  Similarly, a natural court ends on the date when the Reports state that an incumbent justice has died, retired, or resigned.

A justice authors no opinion unless he or she specifies a reason for his or her vote. A bare citation to a previously decided case or a simple statement that the author concurs or dissents because of agreement with a lower court\\'s opinion suffices as an opinion\\r<br/> <br/>2. Where a justice specifies that the opinion applies to an additional case or cases, the opinion is counted as so many separate ones. Thus, the opinions of Brennan and Marshall in Mobile v.

Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, at 545: \"I join the opinion of the Court but with the reservations stated by my Brother Blackmun in his concurring opinion,\" is not listed as as opinion by White. He rather appears as joining Blackmun\\'s concurrence. Conversely, where a justice, in his or her own words only partially agrees with one or more opinions authored by others, he or she is listed as an author.

Thus, each docket number will show a single petitioner and a single respondent, regardless of how many legal entities were actually involved.\\r<br/> <br/>The decision rules governing the identification of parties are as follows.\\r<br/> <br/>1. Parties are identified by the labels given them in the opinion or judgment of the Court except where the Reports title a party as the \"United States\" or as a named state.  Textual identification of parties is typically provided prior to Part I of the Court\\'s opinion.

In describing the parties, the Court employs terminology that places them in the context of the specific lawsuit in which they are involved.

McLean Credit Union, 485 U.S. 617 (1988), in which the majority said that Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit of Kentucky, 410 U.S. 484, 35 L Ed 2d 443 (1973) overruled a 1948 decision.  On the basis of this later language, the earlier decision will contain a \"1\" in this variable.  Alteration also extends to language in the majority opinion that states that a precedent of the Supreme Court has been \"disapproved,\" or is \"no longer good law.\"  \\r<br/> <br/>Note, however, that alteration does not apply to cases in which the Court  \"distinguishes\" a precedent.  Such language in no way changes the scope of the precedent contained in the case that has been distinguished.  \\r<br/> <br/>In addition to following these rules, we consulted several sources. Again, the Congressional Research Service\\'s Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (CONAN) (https://www.congress.gov/constitution-annotated) was most helpful.\\r<br/> <br/>Do not assume that each record of a given case indicates the formal alteration of a separate precedent.  A given citation may have several docket numbers, each of which is governed by a single opinion in which only one precedent was altered. Conversely, an opinion in a citation with a single docket number may alter a whole series of Supreme Court precedents. To determine the number of altered precedents, carefully read the prevailing opinion in each citation that has an entry in this variable.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'),\n",

       "   'his variable provides information about each justice\\'s vote in the case. It appears in the Justice Centered Datasets only. A regular concurrence is when the justice agrees with the Court\\'s opinion as well as its disposition. A special concurence (i.e., a concurence in the judgment) is when the justice agrees with the Court\\'s disposition but not its opinion. A jurisdictional dissent is when the justice disagrees with the Court\\'s assertion or denial of jurisdiction.  Such votes are counted as nonparticipations.\\r<br/> <br/>Determination of how a given justice voted is by no means a simple matter of culling the Reports. The justices do not always make their options clear. \\r<br/> <br/>Two problems, in particular, afflict efforts to specify votes: 1) whether the vote is a regular or a special concurrence, and 2) the treatment to be accorded a vote \"concurring in part and dissenting in part.\" \\r<br/> <br/>The first typically manifests itself when a justice joins the opinion of the Court \"except for . . .\" Because such exceptions typically tend to approach de minimis status, these are coded as regular concurrences. For example, Chief Justice Burger concurred in the opinion of the Court in New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, except for \"footnote 6 thereof.\" 447 U.S. 54, at 71. Similarly, Blackmun\\'s agreement with the Court in Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, except for \"that sentence thereof . . .\" 447 U.S. 74, at 88. Where the Reports identify a justice as \"concurring\" or \"concurring in part\" said justice is treated as a member of the majority opinion coalition (i.e., as = 3), rather than a merely concurring in the result (i.e., as = 4).\\r<br/> <br/>Whereas the preceding problem pertains to determining which type of concurrence a vote is, the problem with votes concurring and dissenting in part is whether they are special concurrences (= 4) or dissents (= 2). This matter was addressed previously in connection with the variable voteUnclear (vote not clearly specified). A vote concurring and dissenting in part is listed as a special concurrence if the justice(s) doing so does not disagree with the majority\\'s disposition of the case. This may occur when: 1) the justice concurring and dissenting in part only voices disagreement with some or all of the majority\\'s reasoning; 2) when said justice disapproves of the majority\\'s deciding or refusing to decide additional issues involved in the case; or 3) when in a case in which dissent has been voiced, the justice(s) concurring and dissenting in part votes to dispose of the case in a manner more closely approximating that of the majority than that of the dissenter(s).\\r<br/> <br/>In cases where determination of whether a vote concurring and dissenting in part is the former or the latter is not beyond cavil, an entry will appear in the voteUnclear variable of the affected case to allow users to make an independent judgment, if they are so minded. Note, however, that listing such votes as dissents (= 2) or special concurrences (= 4) has no effect on whether or not an opinion is written (the opinion variable).\\r<br/> <br/>See also notes under the majority vote (majVote) variable.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'),\n",
