    "## Scenario 1: State tax board\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of:\n",
    "1. Current liquor sales by county\n",
    "2. Projections for the rest of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal for Scenario #1: Your task is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the **yearly liquor sales for each store** using the provided data. \n",
    " * Add up the transactions for each year.\n",
    " * Store sales in 2015 specifically will be used later as your target variable (it may help to use a groupby or pivot table, since you'll use this table to build your model).\n",
    "2. Use the data from 2015 to make a **linear model** using as many variables as you find useful to predict the **yearly sales of each store**\n",
    "  * You must use the *sales from Jan to March per store* as one of your variables.\n",
    "3. Use your model for 2015 to **estimate total sales for each store in 2016**, extrapolating from the sales so far for Jan-March of 2016.\n",
    "4. Report your findings, including any **projected increase or decrease in total sales** (over the entire state) \n",
    "5. Use **cross-validation** to check how your model predicts to held out data compared to the model metrics on the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenging Bonus: We did not cover the topics of regularization for linear regression this week, but those feeling bold can try to use and understand regularizing linear regressions. This will require self-guided research/reading and scikit-learn functions that we have not gone over in class! Use cross-validation to tune the regularization parameter that maximizes R^2 on your holdout sets for the Ridge regression and the Lasso Regression. Do the regularized models perform better than the non-regularized model? Which regularized model performs better? What is the Ridge regression doing? What is the Lasso doing."
