    "#### --Analysis Plan/Approach--\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Check if samples representative of target population\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Use Hypothesis Test for One Sample and a Dichotomous Outcome to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check for difference between the baseline populations and W1/W2 populations for both cohorts in data (services received)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check for difference between Cohort 1 baseline population and Cohort 2 baseline population (services received)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If time permits: Check if changes between Wave 1 outcomes and Wave 2 outcomes for cohort 1 are significant\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If model performs poorly, results of this step may explain part of why...\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Modeling technique: Explore Tree-Based Models\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Tree-based classifier is well-suited for this machine learning problem\n",
    "- Tree-based classifier is easy to understand; stakeholders are non-technical folk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Preprocessing if needed for chosen modeling techniques\n",
    "    \n",
    "- First need to decide how to handle significant portion of the population: Respondents who left question blank or declined to respond\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Then need to use label encoder to transform features and targets into categorical variables (from strings to integers)\n",
    "    \n",
    "A) First, need to group y-variables into one target variable: educational outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  ##### Currently at this point. Groupings will significantly impact results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Need to decide what to include/how (weighting, scoring, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Educational outcome would be based on following features: HighEdCert, EmplySkills, CurrenRoll\n",
    "    - Explain how educational outcome serves as a proxy for other outcomes...\n",
    "        -See this link: http://thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/content/46/6/1.3.full\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Feature Importance in order to reduce dimensionality:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Conduct feature importance in order to select most impactful features\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Build classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train and Test on 2011 data (Wave 2 outcomes based on Wave 1 Services and Demographics data)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build 3 classifiers, cross-validate on 2011 data; x = services_2011, y = outcomes_2013:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "    -kNN neighbors (for comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -logistic regression (for comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare performance scores/metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick best model (or try all....if time permits)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict outcomes_2016 based on services_2014 (wave 2 of cohort 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Evaluate model using: confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get 2015 data\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Predict outcomes_2015 based on services_2011 (wave 3 of cohort 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Evaluate model using: confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Get 2016 data\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Evaluate predictions of outcomes_2016 based on services_2014 (wave 2 of cohort 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Evaluate model using: confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --Initial Findings--\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Setbacks:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Diminishing data: At each stage of the project, I have had to reduce the dataset in order to address missing values and other such issues (data quality issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Roadblocks:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- I am currently in the process of deciding how best to go about feature engineering as well as choosing an appropriate target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Surprises:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Many assumptions, risks, and arbitrary groupings that I have to be mindful of that can totally change my analysis results.\n"
