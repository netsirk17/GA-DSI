Also, it seems that the final columns (e.g., 68+ weeks) don't have any data (seems like all asterisks). I plan to look into this further somehow (like find total NA in column or something).

However, I will rename the 'artist.inverted' column because that label is inaccurate (names for groups of artists, such as a band, are not inverted). I also don't like the dots in the column names. The dots in the column names might cause confusion while coding. I will need to reformat the values in the following columns: 'time', 'date.entered', 'date.peaked'.
