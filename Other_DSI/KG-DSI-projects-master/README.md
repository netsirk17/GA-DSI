# DSI-projects

### Hello to you!

Just some quick info about this repo you have found yourself in:

- I've recently completed a Data Science Immersive (DSI) Program at General Assembly.

- As part of the program curriculum, I was required to complete and submit a project each week (for 7 weeks). The aim for these projects was to apply machine learning and modeling techniques to explore problems in various fields and industries. I also was required to complete my DSI program with a final capstone project. 

- This repo contains the jupyter notebooks used to document the analyses of those 8 projects.

- I have an accompanying github blog post for each project where I explain in some detail what my intended attempt was, the bumps and successes along the way for each project, and the end results. Hopefully it is evident that I got better at this data science stuff with each project. If you are so inclined, check out my posts here: https://kgracia44.github.io/
